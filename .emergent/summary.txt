The previous AI engineer diligently addressed several key features and bug fixes. Initially, they resolved issues with poll mention displays, tackling backend 500 errors, authentication problems in , and correctly resolving option-specific  from IDs to full user objects in  and . Following this, they implemented UI/UX improvements: removing Menciona: text from poll mentions across , , and , and making these mentions clickeable to navigate to user profiles, while retaining user names as requested. The latest task involved displaying mentioned polls in a user's profile Menciones tab, which required creating a new backend endpoint  in  and updating  and  accordingly. Debugging the new backend endpoint involved correcting the  model construction, which has now been verified via .

The overarching goal is to enhance a social polling application by improving its social features and UI. This includes a Social Sharing Panel, dynamic social link management, and resolving User not found errors and post display issues. A major focus has been the poll mention system: ensuring mentioned users appear as avatars in published polls, accurately displaying poll option descriptions, and refining mention visuals. Initially, mentions needed to appear as option-specific elements. Subsequently, the user requested removing the Menciona: text, making mentions clickeable to user profiles, and keeping user names. The current phase aims to display all polls where a user is mentioned within a dedicated Menciones tab on their profile page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and debugged the backend endpoint for retrieving polls where a specific user is mentioned. This involved creating  in . The initial attempts to call this endpoint via  resulted in Internal server error (500) due to validation errors in constructing the  object.

The engineer meticulously reviewed backend logs and , comparing the  construction in the new endpoint with existing, functional poll endpoints. The issue was identified as missing fields and incorrect field references (e.g.,  instead of ) in the  creation logic. A fix was applied to  to ensure all required fields like uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , , , , , and  are correctly populated.

After applying the fix, the endpoint was re-tested using , which confirmed that it now returns a valid  object, including fully resolved  at both general poll and option levels. The backend portion of the Menciones tab feature is now fully functional and verified.
