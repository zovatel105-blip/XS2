The previous AI engineer's work involved an iterative process of feature implementation and rigorous bug fixing, primarily focused on frontend UI and connectivity issues. The initial task was to make layout previews fullscreen on a content creation page. This evolved through several user clarifications, moving from simple sizing adjustments to a full TikTok-like immersive experience with floating controls and a dynamic gradient background. A major hurdle was persistent authentication and backend connectivity issues (Failed to fetch, No se pudo conectar al servidor), which required extensive debugging and the use of a . These were traced to incorrect environment variable usage ( vs ), misconfigured CORS middleware in the backend, and faulty error handling in the frontend's . Simultaneously, a new modular  was developed. The work concluded with efforts to make the design responsive and eliminate a persistent white/black background, leading to modifications in , , and a global CSS reset. The trajectory shows a deep commitment to addressing user feedback and achieving precise visual requirements.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested that layouts on the content creation page should be displayed in fullscreen as a preview, similar to a feed view, and not in the main feed itself. This evolved into a detailed visual requirement for an immersive TikTok/Instagram-like experience, where:
1.  Layouts must occupy the *entire* screen, including the header, without any white/black spaces.
2.  All interactive elements (like Add sound, Describe your publication, music/layout/publish buttons, and X to close) should appear as floating overlays with elegant styling, not occupying dedicated screen space.
3.  The background, when no images are present, should be a consistent, attractive purple-blue-pink gradient, eliminating any white or black sections.
4.  The preview should display a grid of options (e.g., Opción A, Opción B) side-by-side, each with a large circular + button for image upload.
5.  A new, modular  was required, featuring basic email/password fields, frontend validation, redirection to  (which points to ) on successful registration/login, and robust backend error handling.
6.  The final design, specifically the content creation page, must be fully responsive for mobile devices while maintaining its visual integrity on desktop.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   : This is the main entry point for the React application, responsible for routing and global layout.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use  instead of . Modified to include  in  logic and later for  in  logic to ensure fullscreen display and hiding of navigation. Added and then removed temporary demo routes.
-   : The central component for content creation, hosting the .
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications to ensure fullscreen layout previews, including removing size constraints (, ), making it . Repositioned the description input to be smaller and an overlay. Adjusted top/bottom bar compactness. Implemented a  state to toggle between editing and immersive fullscreen. Integrated / from . Changed default  to  (2-column layout). Removed hardcoded . Implemented responsive styling (e.g., ,  prefixes for Tailwind classes). Initialized  state to an empty array to prevent hardcoded images. Added  to its main container.
-   : Manages user authentication logic, including login, registration, and token handling.
    -   **Changes**: Refined error handling logic to correctly differentiate between network errors (Failed to fetch) and authentication errors (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 400 Bad Request) when validating tokens or performing login/registration.
-   : Controls the overall application layout, including conditional rendering based on .
    -   **Changes**: Modified  to  for full height. Updated  logic to explicitly include the  path so that the TikTok fullscreen mode is applied to the content creation page. Added conditional styling to prevent applying  when on the  page.
-   : The newly created authentication component.
    -   **Changes**: New file, implemented with email, password, username, display name fields, frontend validation, loading states, error handling, and redirection logic. It replaced .
-   : Environment variables for the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created with , later corrected from an erroneous preview URL, and finally changed to  to resolve container-specific connectivity issues.
-   : The main FastAPI server file.
    -   **Changes**: The  application order was corrected, moving it *before*  to ensure correct handling of preflight OPTIONS requests.
-   : Global CSS file.
    -   **Changes**: Added a global CSS reset () to ensure the page occupies full height without default browser margins.

<pending_tasks>
- The automated testing still struggles with frontend navigation and button clicks (e.g., Crear una toggle). While the core logic has been confirmed via manual  and  screenshots after navigation, the testing script itself seems to require refinement.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively engaged in resolving a persistent visual bug where a white part or black part was appearing at the bottom of the screen on the content creation page, preventing the design from being truly fullscreen. This was a critical blocker to achieving the desired immersive TikTok-like layout.

The engineer had just performed the following actions to address this:
1.  **Modified **: Changed  to  in the main container of the ResponsiveLayout to force it to occupy the full viewport height.
2.  **Modified **: Added  to the main container of the ContentCreationPage to ensure it explicitly takes up all available height and clips any overflow.
3.  **Modified **: Ensured that the  component itself was configured to use  to occupy its parent's full dimensions.
4.  **Modified **: Checked the gradient background to ensure it also used  to cover its entire parent.
5.  **Modified **: Added a global CSS reset () to eliminate any default browser margins or padding that might be creating unwanted white space at the edges of the viewport.

The next step was to restart the frontend and verify if these changes finally resolved the visual inconsistency.

<optional_next_step>
Restart the frontend to apply the global CSS reset and re-verify the fullscreen display.
