The previous AI engineer primarily focused on debugging and implementing poll mention displays and then shifted to logo modifications. The initial problem involved poll mentions not appearing in the frontend feed, despite backend verification. Key actions included fixing  to include  during data transformation and addressing a critical authentication issue in  that prevented actual backend poll data from loading.

The mention display went through multiple visual iterations based on user feedback and reference images, evolving from simple inline text to dark, overlaid banners, then to banners combined with descriptions, and finally to option-specific cards. Debugging frequently involved adding/removing logs, creating test polls, and direct API calls. A significant detour involved redesigning the quick action logo, making it white, removing its ring, and then replacing it with specific user-provided images. The trajectory ended with the mentions still not appearing, requiring further investigation into data flow and storage at the option level.

The overarching goal was to enhance the social polling application with robust social features and improved UI. Initially, this involved implementing a Social Sharing Panel for user profiles, enabling dynamic management and display of social media links with styled cards and official SVG logos. Key fixes addressed User not found errors, ensuring posts display correctly, and refining the real-time chat system. A major focus was on the poll mention system: ensuring mentioned users appeared as avatars in published polls, correctly displaying poll option descriptions across layouts, and continuously refining the visual presentation of mentions (e.g., as dark horizontal banners, combined with descriptions, and later, as option-specific elements). Additionally, the quick action logo needed to be white, ring-free, and replaced with user-provided image assets, strictly adhering to their exact visual specifications. The latest task revolved around making mentions appear correctly within each poll option's card, rather than as a global poll mention.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines data structures.
    -   **Changes**:  model now includes , signifying option-specific mentions.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: FastAPI backend endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: Confirmed to correctly handle  for both poll creation ( expecting IDs) and retrieval ( returning full  objects).

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes API calls for polls and data transformation.
    -   **Changes**: Initially updated  to include  from the backend. Debug logs were added and removed iteratively.  and  were verified.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Renders the main feed of polls.
    -   **Changes**: Logic around  was temporarily commented out to allow poll loading regardless of authentication status, which was identified as a root cause for mentions not appearing. Debug logs were added and removed.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages global authentication state.
    -   **Changes**: Briefly inspected during the authentication debugging phase.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Displays individual poll items.
    -   **Changes**: Extensively modified to render . Iterations included adding  to various  elements, implementing mention display as horizontal banners (dark overlay, then alongside description), and debugging data flow with temporary visual tests (red boxes) and console logs. The current state is designed to show mentions within the description banner.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Container for the application logo and quick action buttons.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to adjust background color and eliminate elements that created a ring effect around the logo, in conjunction with .

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Renders the application logo.
    -   **Changes**: Modified multiple times to change the logo to completely white, remove any surrounding rings, then implement two different user-provided angular SVG logos, and finally, directly embed the latest user-provided logo image as-is.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages the TikTok-style vertical scroll feed of polls.
    -   **Changes**: Mentions were initially added after the poll title. Later, they were removed from the title and re-added there again temporarily. Finally, they were removed from the general title to ensure option-specific display handled by layout components.

    -   **Importance**: Handle the rendering of poll options.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to display  (instead of ) *above* the option description within each individual option card.

-   **Poll Mentions Display in Feed**: The primary issue is that mentions, despite being correctly handled in the backend and passed to frontend components, are still not visibly appearing in the feed.
-   **Data Storage Verification**: Investigate why mentions stopped showing, specifically verifying if they are being correctly stored and retrieved at the option level.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in debugging the persistent issue of poll mentions not appearing in the frontend feed. This problem resurfaced after multiple attempts to correctly implement the visual display and after a significant authentication fix. The user explicitly stated, Porque dejaron de mostrarse las menciones (Because the mentions stopped showing).

The AI engineer's last action was to reiterate the need to investigate why mentions ceased appearing, specifically considering if the data is being correctly stored and retrieved at the option level, as opposed to the general poll level. This suggests a potential regression or a new data flow issue despite prior fixes. The current focus is to re-evaluate the data integrity from creation to display, starting from the backend's storage mechanism for option-specific mentions.

Verify how option-specific mentions are stored in the database by directly querying a poll with mentions at the option level.
